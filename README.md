# Berthas-Aquatic-Petting-Zoo-UE4
GITHUB DESCRIPTION:  Howard be thine feesh!  Play what Loretta done told you not to play, at:  Bertha's Aquatic Petting Zoo!!!  This demo features hand tracking and is built for the Quest 1/2 in UE4. In it, I attempt to show off some of the amazing aquatic fellers. (Completely flappable!) You can find the demo here: http://trashhaven.com/games/AquaticPettingZooDemo/  HARDWARE:  DO NOT EVER BUY THIS DEMO if you are a console only developer! I don't know why the demo has to be PC-only, but I'm not paying for this, I'm PAYING to own Howard in the game! No tricks, tricks, no cheats and this demo is NOT freeware! Don't buy the game if you don't want to! It's on sale too, just sayin'!  FUNDED:  $5.00  Features  Hand tracking input!  Custom menu music by Vemork  Adds greentext to logs  Tweaks and improvements  Update Notes  Version 0.1.1  FIXED:  Fixed a camera bug with gay frogs.  Fixed basic joypad crashing.  Version 0.1.0  MOVED TO XBOX ONE PATCH  Added "Loading" video.  Implemented refactor by Chris Rees.  STUCK:  There is no user interface. At least there was not at the moment of this writing.  Everything is still optional and done by the game client on the server.  NO DOOR MECHANICS  Still has no "how do I pay money to own the game"  Version 0.0.1  An updated version is out! It's on it's way to complete beta.  Most of the following features will not work. These features may eventually be added though.
